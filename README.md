# Medical-imaging-using-SONAR
HERE IN THIS PROJECT WE ARE AIMED AT MAKING USE OF SONAR FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES.
I.E., TO DETECT CYSTS , CANCER CELLS, FOETUS HEALTH, ETC. 
THIS METHOD IS CALLED SONOGRAM.
We are given two Sonar signals (transmitted signal x(n) and received signal y(n)) . 
At first the received signal y(n) is passed through a band pass filter to remove noise and interference.
Then, the filtered signal is cross-correlated with the transmitted signal x(n) to find the lag for the maximum similarity.
